                /* Some explanations:

        The +1 is added to the result of nextInt(10) to shift the range of random numbers generated from 0-9 to 1-10.
        By default, nextInt(n) returns a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and n (exclusive). So nextInt(10) would give a number between 0 and 9.
        But since we want a number between 1 and 10 for this game, we add +1 to the result to offset it by 1 and get the desired range.
        So nextInt(10) + 1 gives a random int from 1 to 10, instead of 0 to 9.

        keyboard.close();
        This statement does some housekeeping to disconnect the Java program from
        the computer keyboard. Using close() to explicitly detach from the keyboard is good practice.
