        So for each of the 3 copies, it will print a 5 row triangle pattern by printing the

        The 4 here is because the full triangle is 5 rows tall. Since it starts from 0, the last row is row 4.

        By subtracting the current row number, we get the number of asterisks to print for that row:

        On row 0, 4 - 0 = 4 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) > 5 asterisks
        On row 1, 4 - 1 = 3 (0, 1, 2, 3) > 4 asterisks
        On row 2, 4 - 2 = 2 (0, 1, 2) > 3 asterisks
        On row 3, 4 - 3 = 1 (0, 1) > 2 asterisk
        On row 4, 4 - 4 = 0 (0) > 1 asterisks (loop ends immediately)

        Output:

        *****  // Row 0 (5 asterisks)
        ****   // Row 1 (4 asterisks)
        ***    // Row 2 (3 asterisks)
